Homebrew-old
============
Based on Homebrew/homebrew-versions, these formulae provide older
versions of certain packages.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap ilikepi/old` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you
can `brew install ilikepi/old/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/ilikepi/homebrew-old/master/<formula>.rb
```
